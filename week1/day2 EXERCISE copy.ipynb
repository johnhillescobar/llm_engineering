    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to provide clear definitions for three core concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs): neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers. I think I remember that these terms are interconnected in computing and AI but I'm not entirely sure about all the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, starting with a Neural Network. From what I recall, a neural network is a type of model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's biological neural networks. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" which process data through these connections to extract patterns and make decisions or predictions. These networks are used in various AI tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and more. But I'm not 100% certain about all the components involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, attention mechanisms. I think this has something to do with how models focus on specific parts of input data. The idea is that during computation, or when processing input, the model can weigh each part by its relevance or importance. This could be similar to how humans and animals pay attention to important words or facial features. Without attention, a neural network might process all inputs at once without prioritizing, which would limit its performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, transformers themselves. I remember there are different models, and transformers might refer to one specific variant. From what I can gather, transformers use self-attention mechanisms. That means each part of the model can compute how important it is for any other piece when processing input. This seems crucial because it allows the model to weigh the importance dynamically, which improves efficiency and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together: A neural network is an AI model inspired by the brain, consisting of layers that process data through connected nodes. Attention mechanisms let models focus on specific data parts during computation, often using self-attention from transformers where each part computes its importance relative to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if these definitions are all correct. Maybe I should verify each term's accuracy. Also, how do they interrelate? Is every transformer a neural network with attention layers? That seems logical because understanding input is a key function of both types of models, and self-attention is a core component for transformers. Neural networks themselves might consist of multiple layers that include attention mechanisms to process data effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure each definition is distinct but connected. The user requested some core concepts behind LLMs, so I need to highlight not just the components but also their role in processing language tasks effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I should structure it as follows: For each term (neural network, attention, transformer), define it briefly then tie them together explaining how transformers rely on the neural network's function and include attention in their computation. That way, the user gets a clear understanding.\n",

      "   A neural network is an AI model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process information through layers, enabling it to extract patterns and make decisions or predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Attention Mechanisms:**\n",
      "   In computing systems, attention refers to how models focus on specific parts of input data during computation. During processing, the model assigns weights to each part based on their relevance, allowing the system to dynamically prioritize important components without overly complex structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transformers:**\n",
      "   Transformers are a type of AI architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms within their layers. This allows each component in the model to compute its importance relative to others when processing input data, enhancing efficiency and performance by enabling dynamic focus on relevant parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "These concepts interrelate with transformers relying on neural networks for their self-attention processes when computing attention, making them particularly effective at handling complex language tasks.\n"
