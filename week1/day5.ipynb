      "We've just revamped the @Huggingface Quantization docs! ü•≥\n",
      "Understand concepts better & choose the right technique for your needs¬†with these key updates:\n",
      "- Explanations of quantization fundamentals (schemes, int4, FP8).\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/etQG9FQw\n",
      "- New Selection Guide: Choose the right technique (bnb, AWQ, GPTQ, HQQ, etc.) for your specific needs & hardware.\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/eRVyQsAW\n",
      "- Benchmarks: accuracy & performance data for popular quantization methods on Llama 3.1 8B & 70B.\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/eqSNvsTa\n",
      "What's quantization? It shrinks models (like Llama 3) & speeds up inference by using lower precision (int8, int4, FP8). Think smaller footprint, faster results!\n",
      "Our new concept guide covers key ideas like:\n",
      "üîπ Affine vs Symmetric\n",
      "üîπ int4 Packing\n",
      "üîπ FP8 (E4M3 vs E5M2)\n",

      "üî• Benchmarks! We tested popular methods (bitsandbytes, AWQ, GPTQ, HQQ, torchao, FP8 & more) on Llama 3.1 8B & 70B.\n",
      "Key Takeaways:\n",
      "8-bit: Matches baseline accuracy, ~2x memory saving.\n",
      "4-bit: Great balance (~4x saving), AWQ/GPTQ often lead accuracy (need calibration), bnb/HQQ easy on-the-fly.\n",
      "Sub-4-bit: Max compression, but bigger accuracy drop.\n",
      "See the results:\n",

      "Which method for YOU?\n",
      "Our new \"Selecting a Quantization Method\" guide helps you decide!\n",
      "We compare:\n",
      "On-the-fly (Easy): bitsandbytes, HQQ, torchao - No calibration needed.\n",
      "Calibration-based (High Accuracy): AWQ, GPTQ - Need data, potentially better results.\n",
      "Fine-tuning: QLoRA via bitsandbytes is the standard.\n",
